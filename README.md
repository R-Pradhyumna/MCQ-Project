Welcome to the MCQ Project.

Aim: Design a software which takes input from professors and generates 4 different versions of the question paper.

Tech Stack used:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript

The index.html file serves as the entry point to the website where users are giveen two options, one can create a new paper or upload an already existing XML file to generate PDFs.

The GeneratePapers.html file allows users to upload the XML file of the entered questions and verify the inputs,

Clicking on the Generate PDFS button will automatically download 4 PDFs where the questions and options are shuffled randomly, the correct answer being highlighted.

This is currently Phase 1 of the project, For Phase-2 i have thought of designing a web document where the word format template is displayed to the users and they can download the word document directly without having to worry about alignment issues and shuffling.
